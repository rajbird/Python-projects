import sqlite3
#This Python script retrieves the names and email addresses of all users who have made at least one order, along with the total amount of money they have spent on all their orders. The script then prints out this information in descending order by total amount spent, with the highest-spending users at the top. The script uses Python's sqlite3 library to connect to a database containing two tables, 'users' and 'orders', and then executes a SQL query to retrieve the required information.

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Write the SQL query

SELECT u.name, u.email, SUM(o.total_price) as total_spent
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o
ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.id
HAVING COUNT(o.id) >= 1
ORDER BY total_spent DESC

# Execute the SQL query and retrieve the results
c.execute(query)
results = c.fetchall()

# Extract the required information and store it in a list of tuples
